# Ox2h5

This program stitches data obtained on Oxford Instruments's Aztec systems (until 3.3 SP1) to a Bruker style .h5 file type to enable compatibility with xEBSD v3. 

1) Export the data in Aztec to a .ctf file along with patterns as .tiff (the patterns are usually exported to a separate folder)
2) The input parameters in the ox2h5.m script enable selection of the ctf file and corresponding patterns.
3) A stitched .h5 file is obtained that can be used with xEBSD v3.
